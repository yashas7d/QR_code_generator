This is my 5th semester Computer Communications and Netwroks project. It is QR code generator using socket programming in python. Once the server is run and connection is established to local host, the client is run and the user can enter a url and a QR code is generated for the given url. We have used python libraries like socketserver, http.server, urllib.parse, BytesIO for server. We have used python libraries like QRcode, tkinter, requests, PIL, IO.
